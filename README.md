# QMAST Sailcode

Set your Arduino sketchbook directory to be the directory within this
repository called "sketchbook", cause you know, names.

I'm not changing the name of the repository from Sailcode, but I have changed
the main sketch name to "ferrycode". As we move on through the project, we
will change the name whenever we make a big breakthrough.
